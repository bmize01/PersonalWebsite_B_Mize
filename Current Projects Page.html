<h1>Current Projects </h1>
<p>I am not sure if I am supposed to reuse the material that we did for our other assignments, but I thought a good video to explain a project is the video below. I made this video as a description of what the business is and what it cares about, as well as, where it wants to go in the future. In this video, I am talking about my latest desire to break into a new endeavor and pursue my passion for photography.</p>

<p>Among that, I have been working on alternative methods to stained glass. I have attached some pictures below that show what the final product looks like. The method I used below to create this effect is a painting technique. Plaid Online makes a painting product called &quot;Gallery Glass: Stained Glass Effect&quot; paint. I am interested in what else I can make from this product. I have made a variety of products here and might sell them in the future. I am currently researching the best ways to hang certain items I created with this product.</p>

<p>Those are just two examples of current projects that I am doing and trying to accomplish. Additionally, I have been writing and want to make a poetry collection. I need to research ways to get published and get out of my comfort zone. I am working on my hand-cut paper cut art. I have also been crocheting. I made a little stuffed animal frog, and plan to make more in the future. I don't have any photographs of the final project because my cousin thought it was a gift and took it. I have not seen it since. As mentioned on the homepage I am not afraid to try anything new especially when it comes to art!</p>
