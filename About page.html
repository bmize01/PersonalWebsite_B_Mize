  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am an artist. I call myself a jack of all trades. However, I have found most satisfaction in photography and poetry. Those are my two most prominent creative forms. I am trying to start a photography business called Bee Rose Portraits. I haven't branched out, but I wrote a business plan. </p>
  <p>On top of being an artist, I am also finishing my last semester at the University of New Mexico. I am gaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in Liberal Arts. I have studied, Arts Business and Marketing, Communication, English, and a variety of Fine Art. In the future, I am looking to become an English or Art teacher to pursue my dreams of making a profit from my photography. I am hoping to accomplish this through an online school here in New Mexico. </p>
  <p>Additionally, I want to purchase a house in the upcoming years. This goal seems large considering my age, but I don't like to put limits on myself or people. It reminds me of the sentiment that to be good at something means you have to start doing it even if it is not &quot;successful&quot; at the beginning! I value hard work, truth, and kindness. Through my work in art, I hope to show each of these values and that they are apparent. </p>
