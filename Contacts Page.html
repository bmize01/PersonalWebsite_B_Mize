<p>I would love to hear from you! I want to know what your feedback is on my site! Please tell me what you think I did well, and what you think I did not do well. </p>
<p>I think for the first time completing a website such as this I pulled it off well. I included videos about my business Bee Rose Portraits, and I included images that helped to decorate the site. All my pages are in the same style and format. </p>
<p>Anyways, I cannot wait to see what you have to say. We can even work out commissions! I accept inquiries for art projects or any ideas! Thank you! </p>
<p>The link below will take you directly to your email app to email me. </p>
