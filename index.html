  <h1>Welcome to Brianna's Website</h1><p>Hello! I am happy to see you stop by. Please  take this website with a grain of salt since it is my first time ever designing  a website on Adobe Dreamweaver. </p>
  <p>On this website we have 5 pages that have  different content relating back to my art practice! My brand name is Bee Rose Imagery.  I create art across the board. I focus on photography and poetry. However, I am  a jack of all trades. I have dipped my toes in painting, non-fiction writing,  papercutting, sewing, crocheting, or anything else that might fit into the  creative arts practices.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Overview </h2>
<p>I will  be using this website to talk about what I do, and why I care about it.  Secondly, I am including a portfolio to display my photography in which are  completed photographs from different photo sessions that I have had recently. My  current projects will function similarly to the portfolio, but we are going to  talk more about different art forms separate from photography and what I am  working on and what I hope to do in the future. Finally, on our last page there  is an opportunity to send me an email for inquiries and questions about what I  am doing! I hope to hear from you!</p>
